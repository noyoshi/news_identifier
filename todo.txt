I have:
1. Read in the data from the csvs
2. Scrubbed out the name of thier publishers
3. Tokenized them (using nltk)
4. Created class for reading in data, holding data, and organizing the data
5. Enabled one of the classes (ArticleCollection) to be able to normalize all the articles (so that
there is an even spread scross all publishers)
6. Enabled ArticleCollection to split itself into testing, training, and
developing data.

We need to:
1. Figure out what metrics we will use
2. Implement a baseline
3. Evaluate this baseline
